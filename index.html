        <p id="step1"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get a small onion or some shallots cooking in oil. Once they've softened, let them cool -- they'll be going in your meatballs.
</p>
     <p id="step2"><strong>Step 2:</strong> In a large bowl, mix up the ground meat (no, it doesn't need to be lean!) with your cooled onions, tomato paste, cheese,  breadcrumbs (I use panko), a splash of milk, and an egg. If it feels too wet, add more breadcrumbs and/or cheese. I love a ton of cheese, to be candid. If you have some parsley or oregano and people who don't balk at green in their meatballs, you may chop a bit up and add it.</p> 
     
     <p id="step3"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Make balls in your hand about the size of two golf balls into one. Please keep them uniform so they cook evenly.
</p>

<p id="step4"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Refill your frying pan with a enough oil to cover the balls halfway. Get it going till shimmering. (Alternately, you can simmer the balls in your sauce.) Add the balls one at a time. Do not crowd them. You may well have to do this in batches.
</p>

<p id="step5"><strong>Step 5:</strong> Nudge them around the pan with a spatula from time to time. The key here is to keep them from burning, but also to cook them all the way through. You will end up with some that are more crispy than others but just try to control the heat. Pick a sentinel meatball to test for doneness. This should take about ten minutes.
</p>

<p id="step6"><strong>Step 6:</strong> Now cook some pasta, while you remove your balls to drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Serve with pasta and red sauce or plain butter and cheese and black pepper. How you serve them is up to you.
